# Recreated Regiohashing Tool
Recreating [Hessophane's Geohashing Minesweeper-Regiohashing tool](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/User:Hessophanes/Regiohashing) which has [since become defunct](http://hessophanes.de/xkcd/xkcdregio.cgi?about) (I think).

That probably doesn't make much sense to anyone who doesn't know what [Geohashing](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/Main_Page) is.

I'm going to be making this in Javascript and... oh, did I mention that I've never properly used Javascript before?

## Current Progress
I've completed:
- Painstakingly creating sprites
- Writing code to link the sprites together on a \<canvas>
  - Not including the numbers at the top

I need to:
- Create a similar text-to-map converter to the original
- Create a way to identify what square correlates to what graticule
- Do the numbers at the top
- Do the numbers in the map

Extras:
- Recreating all the maps that the original had
- Giving it the capability to check a user page for an a/s/g tag
- Overall just getting it to the standard that the original was
